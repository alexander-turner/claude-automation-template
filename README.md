# Claude Automation Template

A GitHub template that makes [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) work reliably on your repositories. It wires up git hooks, CI workflows, and Claude session hooks so that Claude can autonomously fix code, create PRs, and respond to `@claude` mentions — with safeguards to prevent broken code from shipping or runaway token spend.

## Why Use This

**Without this template**, using Claude Code on a repo requires manually configuring hooks, writing CI workflows, and building guardrails against common failure modes (infinite retry loops, pushing broken code, inconsistent formatting).

**With this template**, you get all of that out of the box:

- **Pre-push verification** — Claude runs your build, lint, and type checks before every push
- **Post-push CI watching** — Claude waits for CI to pass and gets told to fix failures (with a retry cap so it doesn't burn tokens forever)
- **Enforced code quality** — Conventional Commits, Prettier formatting, and lint-staged run on every commit
- **`@claude` GitHub integration** — mention Claude in issues or PR comments and it responds with full repo context
- **Automatic template sync** — downstream repos receive improvements daily via PR, with conflict detection that preserves your customizations
- **Multi-language support** — Node.js (pnpm), Python (uv/ruff/pytest), and shell (shfmt/shellcheck) work out of the box

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create repo from template (click "Use this template" on GitHub)
# 2. Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo-url> && cd <your-repo> && ./setup.sh
```

Then [install the Claude GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/claude) to enable `@claude` mentions and CI failure tracking.

| `template-sync.yaml`            | Daily sync from template repo with conflict detection                 |
| `phone-home.yaml`               | Propagates "Lessons Learned" from merged PRs back to the template     |

## Customization

After creating your repo from the template, configure these files:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Add your project-specific context for Claude
- **`package.json`** — Wire up your `dev`, `build`, `test`, `lint`, and `check` scripts
- **`.github/workflows/comment-on-failed-checks.yaml`** — Add your CI workflow names

Unconfigured scripts are skipped gracefully — no failures on first push.

## Automatic Updates

Template improvements sync daily at 9am UTC. You can also trigger manually from Actions → "Sync from Template". Changes arrive as a PR for you to review, and local customizations are preserved.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Git 2.9+
